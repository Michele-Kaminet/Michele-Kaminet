Hey there!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying to obtain my BBA comprised of a minor in Entrepreneurship and 3 certificates, Administration, Applied Marketing and either Analysis or Analytics. I'm still deciding. Pray for me or just me positive vibes!
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my certifications to become a Business Intelligence Engineer...perhaps...unless I fall in love with a particular subject on the path! So, nowhere to start but at the beginning. I will update this section as I go along!

Current Topics: Excel, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Data Analysis

ðŸ‘¯ Later on, I will be looking to collaborate on projects and contests. When I get there, I'll send up the smoke signal!
ðŸ¤” I may need some help with coding Python and higher math, such as statistics, and maybe calculus. It depends on what is required.

âš¡ Fun Facts + Cryptic info: A lifelong learner, I started out in music touring for a few years. I then went into traditional marketing and had a fun run. A major system outage took me out of the field. I was on standby for a while during which I started my bachelor's degree. I'm halfway through it now, and I obtained a hardware upgrade this summer! La vita Ã¨ bella!

Cheers!
